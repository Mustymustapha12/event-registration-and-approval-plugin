# DISI Summit Portal

WordPress plugin for DISI Summit 2026 registration capture, review, pricing,
payment notifications, and form-provider integration.

## Latest Release

Version `0.5.4`

Installable package:
`outputs/disi-summit-portal-v0.5.4.zip`

## Source

The editable plugin source is in:
`work/DISI Summit Portal V0.1.1`

The internal folder name remains stable so WordPress replaces the installed
plugin during ZIP uploads instead of creating a second plugin.

## Site Approval

Version `0.5.4` requires a signed approval key for each WordPress
installation. The owner-only generator is documented in
`owner-tools/README.md`. Its private signing key is excluded from Git and from
the installable plugin package.
